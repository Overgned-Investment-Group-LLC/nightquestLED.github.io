## DIY Kit & Savings
Love tinkering and 3D printing? We've got great news! Download the 3D files for the Quest mount absolutely free and print your own mount. Opt for this DIY route, and you'll receive a $10 discount on your purchase. Buy our PCB/electronics kit for just $20, and with a quick assembly time of under 15 minutes (excluding print time), you'll have your NightQuestLED ready to roll!

## ESP32 Onboard: Powering Infinite Possibilities
Harness the power of our onboard ESP32 microcontroller. A cornerstone feature, it allows you to:

**Open Source Firmware**: Customize and modify the device firmware to suit your unique needs. Dive into the code and make it yours.

**Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates**: As we innovate and improve, get firmware updates directly to your device without any hassle.

**Bluetooth Communication**: Seamlessly connect the NightQuestLED to your Quest 2 via Bluetooth. This integration opens up a realm of real-time interactions, such as adjusting the RGB or IR LED based on game dynamics or ambient conditions.

**Dynamic Adjustments with Quest's Passthrough API**: In a future software release we will add the capability for the IR & RGB LEDs to adjust their brightness in tandem with the ambient light changes detected by the cameras of the Quest 2, enabling perfect lighting, every time.

**Shared Space Multiplayer Enhancements**: With the rise of shared-space VR experiences, use the RGB to signify teams, player statuses, and more. Whether you're in a competitive match or a collaborative effort, let the RGB tell the story.

**Versatile Lighting**: Need more illumination? Switch the RGB NeoPixels to act as powerful white LEDs, ensuring optimal visibility even in vast, dark environments.

The potential is vast. With NightQuestLED, you're not just buying a product; you're stepping into a world of endless VR enhancements and possibilities.

## Safety Precautions
Your safety is paramount. Always ensure:
- Do not look directly into the LEDs for extended periods of time. Humans cannot see IR light, but it carries energy like all other wavelenghts, while likely safe at the power levels used, it has not been independently tested and declared safe yet. 
- The device might get hot, avoid touching it for 1 minute after turning off the IR LEDs
